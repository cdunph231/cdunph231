- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Conor!

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Full Stack Software Development, particularly with React.js, Node.js and Typescript. I've also been developing on AWS for almost 5 years, I'm a big fan of the range of services they provide, and have extensive experience with their serverless offerings.
